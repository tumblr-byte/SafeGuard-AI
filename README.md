## Intelligent Real-Time Harassment Detection System  
**Built for:** Thales GenTech India Hackathon 2025  
**Theme:** Cybersecurity  

---

## Overview  

SafeGuard AI is an intelligent harassment detection system that protects users from online threats in real-time by combining **Artificial Intelligence** and **Blockchain technology**.  

It is designed to detect, record, and prevent online harassment, providing victims with **tamper-proof evidence** and **instant protection**.

## Problem Statement  

### The Crisis  

Online harassment and cyberbullying are serious concerns in India, especially for women.  

- Reports show a steady rise in harassment across social media and digital platforms.  
- Cyberbullying cases have increased significantly since the pandemic, with many incidents going unreported.  
- Victims often struggle to collect digital evidence to support their cases.  
- Major platforms face challenges in real-time detection and moderation.  
- Psychological impacts such as stress, anxiety, and fear of online spaces remain widespread.  

### The Challenge  

Current solutions often lack:  
- Real-time detection  
- Immutable evidence for legal cases  
- Pattern recognition for coordinated attacks   
- Victim-centric design  

---

## Solution  

SafeGuard AI addresses these challenges through a **three-layer protection system**:

### 1. AI Detection Layer  
- Uses pre-trained **Toxic-BERT** model  
- Real-time analysis (< 500ms)  
- Detects: sexual harassment, violent threats, hate speech, abusive language  
- Categorizes severity: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW  

### 2. Blockchain Evidence Layer  
- Logs every threat to an immutable blockchain  
- Generates tamper-proof evidence for court use  
- Stores: timestamp, threat type, severity, content hash  
- Victims can download evidence reports anytime  

### 3. Pattern Detection Layer  
- Identifies coordinated harassment campaigns  
- Links multiple accounts targeting the same user  
- Detects escalation patterns  
- Alerts users about organized attacks  

**Why Blockchain?**  
- Stores instances securely  
- Tamper-proof: even if the original content is deleted, evidence remains  
- Includes timestamp and threat type for each user  

---

## Pattern Recognition for Coordinated Attacks  

Detects when a user receives multiple threatening or toxic comments from different accounts in a short period.

Flags possible coordinated harassment campaigns instead of treating each comment individually.

Summarizes the attack:

- Number of threats  
- Accounts involved  
- Time span of the attack  

Helps protect users by providing early warnings and allowing for escalation or reporting of organized attacks.
